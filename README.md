Description:

This Python script performs automatic text summarization using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). It begins by cleaning the input text—removing citations and extra whitespace—then tokenizes it into sentences and words. Common stopwords (e.g., "the", "is", "in") are filtered out to focus on meaningful words. Each sentence is scored based on the frequency of its important words, giving higher scores to sentences that contain more relevant terms. The script then selects the top-scoring sentences, limited by a user-defined number (max_sentences), and combines them into a summary. This approach allows the tool to condense large blocks of text into concise and informative outputs, making it useful for quickly extracting key points from articles, documents, or reports.
